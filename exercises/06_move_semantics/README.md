# Move Semantics

These exercises are adapted from [pnkfelix](https://github.com/pnkfelix)'s [Rust Tutorial](https://pnkfelix.github.io/rust-examples-icfp2014/) -- Thank you Felix!!!

## Further information

For this section, the book links are especially important.

- [Ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html)
- [Reference and borrowing](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html)

## Personal Note
In this part of the challenges, I learned quite a lot about rust syntax and ownership. 
Even thought I still get help in VS code, but  I have faith that the lesson sticks better as a result of failing and trying. I notice that when I don't learn for a give period I forget things easier. 
Thus I need to consistently learn and practice rust, to maintain th MOMENTUM REQUIRED FOR ESCAPE VELOCITY.
